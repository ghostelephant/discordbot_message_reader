A simple program that will prompt you for the following:

- A Discord bot token
- A Discord user ID
- Optionally, a specific message ID in the DMs with that user

and print out the content of the messages to your console.

## Prerequisites:

- Git and Node.js must be installed.
- Yarn is recommended (though you can probably run it using NPM instead).

## To run:

- Clone this repository
- Open the directory containing the repo
- Install Node modules
- Run the file `main.js` using Node


```
$ git clone https://github.com/ghostelephant/discordbot_message_reader.git
$ cd discordbot_message_reader
$ yarn
$ node main.js
```

(If you don't have `yarn`, you can try `npm i` in line 3)
